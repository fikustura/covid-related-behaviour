# COVID-19 Attitudes & Behaviors Analysis

This university project results in an interactive Jupyter Notebook file (`.ipynb`) that can be opened in an appropriate environment. While it can also be accessed on GitHub, please note that the interactive features will not be available in that format. However, the final display remains identical.

## Project Overview

The notebook provides a detailed, step-by-step process for retrieving, cleaning, and visualizing data related to COVID-19 attitudes and behaviors across three distinct countries — Canada, Denmark, and Japan — each representing a different continent. The process is presented in Croatian.

## Course Information

This project was developed as part of the graduate elective course **_Mathematical Software_** in April 2022.

## Additional Resources

- For more information about the survey, please visit the  [Imperial College London's website](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/centre-for-health-policy/our-work/our-response-to-covid-19/covid-19-behaviour-tracker/).
- Explore the data source at the  [YouGov covid-19-tracker repository](https://github.com/YouGov-Data/covid-19-tracker), which includes both numerical and non-numerical responses of survey participants, along with the corresponding questions and clarifications.

## Future Work

Potential extensions of this project could include expanding to additional countries, or implementing machine learning techniques to predict attitudes based on demographic factors.
